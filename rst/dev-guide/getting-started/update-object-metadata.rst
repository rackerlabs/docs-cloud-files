Updating object metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To set or update custom metadata for existing objects, you send an HTTP
**POST** request with a valid authentication token. Metadata is set by
using the header ``X-Object-Meta-name: value``, where name is the custom
name for your metadata and value is the data value.

..  note:: 
    If an object has custom metadata, when you post new metadata, you must
    resend any metadata that you want kept with the object or it will be
    lost.

An HTTP status code of 202 (Accepted) in the response indicates that the
metadata for the object was successfully updated.
