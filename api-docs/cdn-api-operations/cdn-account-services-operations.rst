CDN account services operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can perform the operations described in this section at the account level of your Cloud Files CDN account.

The examples in this section use sample values for the following:

- account — for example, MossoCloudFS_0672d7fa-9f85-4a81-a3ab-adb66a880123

- X-Auth-Token — for example, f064c46a782c444cb4ba4b6434288f7c

For your own requests, you must use your own account information and authentication token. For more information, see :ref:`Authentication <auth>`. Your authentication token and your account information are in the service catalog that is produced.
