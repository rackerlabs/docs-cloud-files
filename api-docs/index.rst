Rackspace Cloud Filesâ„¢ is an affordable, redundant, scalable, and
dynamic storage service. The core storage system is designed to provide
a secure, network-accessible way to store an unlimited number of files.
Each file can be as large as 5 gigabytes. You can store as much as you
want and pay only for storage space that you actually use.

Cloud Files also provides a simple yet powerful way to publish and
distribute content behind a content delivery network (CDN). As a Cloud
Files user, you get access to this network automatically.

Cloud Files enables you to store and retrieve files and CDN-enabled
content through a RESTful (Representational State Transfer) web services
interface. There are also language-specific application programming
interfaces (APIs) that use the RESTful API and make it easy for
developers to integrate into their applications.

This document describes the features available with API |contract version|.

This guide is intended to assist software developers who want to develop
applications by using the application programming interface (API) for the
Rackspace Cloud Backup service.

To use the information provided here, you should have a general understanding
of the
:how-to:`Cloud Files FAQ<cloud-files-faq>` and have a `Rackspace Cloud account`_
with access to the Cloud Files service. You should also be familiar with the
following technologies:

-  RESTful web services

-  HTTP/1.1

-  JSON data serialization format

System administrators and others interested in the storage and CDN
benefits of Cloud Files should consider using the File Manager interface
within the Rackspace Cloud Control Panel, `Jungle
Disk <http://www.jungledisk.com/>`__, or third-party tools such as
`Cyberduck <http://www.cyberduck.ch/>`__. The Rackspace Cloud Control
Panel provides an easy to use web-based interface for uploading content
to and downloading content from Cloud Files.
